# SunHack-Hackathon
## Inspiration
To make it easier for anyone to retrieve information from the website within seconds.

## What it does
It scrapes Informations from zindi.africa to collect active Hackathons and their regions.

## How I built it
The program is built on python and html.

## Challenges I ran into
I didn't know about the Email library at first, so I had to learn how to use it.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
The webscraper is fully functional and I now know how to use the email library in python.

## What I learned
Email automation.

## What's next for Webscraper for Zindi Active Hackathons
I'd probably translate it into a desktop or mobile app and add some cool automation features
